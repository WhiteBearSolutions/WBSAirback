Description: FUSE-based single file backing store via Amazon S3
 s3backer is a filesystem that contains a single file backed by the
 Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3). As a filesystem, it is
 quite small and simple: it provides a single normal file having a
 fixed size. The file is divided up into blocks, and the content of
 each block is stored in a unique Amazon S3 object. In other words,
 what s3backer provides is really more like an S3-backed virtual hard
 disk device, rather than a filesystem.
