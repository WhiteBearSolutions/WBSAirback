.SH NAME
device.conf \- Configuration file for
.BR vtllibrary(1)
and
.BR vtltape(1)
.SH DESCRIPTION
.\" Add any additional description here
.PP
Each configured device contains a unique entry in device.conf

Each section starts at column 1 and is terminated by a blank line.
.IP e.g.
Library: 10 CHANNEL: 00 TARGET: 00 LUN: 00
 Vendor identification: SPECTRA
 Product identification: PYTHON
 Product revision level: 550V
 Unit serial number: XYZZY_A
 NAA: 10:22:33:44:ab:00:00:00
.PP
Where descriptor
.B Library:
or
.B Drive:
starts each section The descriptor is followed by a unique ID (a decimal number)

On the same line following the descriptor is the SCSI corrordinates for the
device described.

.B Vendor identification,
.B Product identification,
.B Product revision level
and
.B Unit serial number
are common fields across all device types.

.B NAA
field is used by some backup software (e.g. Legato) as means to uniquely identify devices. It is used by INQUIRY VPD page 0x83. Most software uses the
.B Unit serial number
as the unique identifier.

.PP
.B Drive:
entries can optionally contain identifiers
.B READ_ONLY:
.B READ_WRITE:
.B WORM:
and
.B ENCRYPTION:

If none of the above identifiers are specified for a tape device, than there is
.I NO
restrictions on the types of media mounted into this drive.

If
.I ANY
of the above identifiers are defined for the drive, only media types defined
can be mounted with the defined restriction(s)

.IP e.g.
Drive: 34 CHANNEL: 00 TARGET: 12 LUN: 00
 Library ID: 30 Slot: 04
 Vendor identification: IBM
 Product identification: ULT3580-TD4
 Product revision level: 550V
 Unit serial number: XYZZY_B4
 NAA: 30:22:33:44:ab:00:12:00
 Compression: factor 1 enabled 1
 READ_ONLY: LTO_2
 READ_ONLY: LTO_3
 READ_WRITE: LTO_4
 WORM: LTO_3
 WORM: LTO_4
 ENCRYPTION: LTO_4
.PP

In the above example, LTO2 and LTO3 media will be mounted READ-ONLY, LTO4 media
will be mounted READ-WRITE. The device will support LTO3 & LTO4 WORM media.
Encrption is only allowed using LTO4 media.

.IP
Note: LTO3 WORM media will be READ-ONLY as WORM or'ed with READ_ONLY
.PP
.IP
Note 2: There is nothing stopping the user from defining nonsense settings like

.IP
 READ_WRITE: LTO_4
 READ_WRITE: SDLT600
.PP
for the same drive.

.B Compression:
factor
.B X
enabled
.B Y

Where
.PP
.B X
is 1 through 9.
.IP
1 is fastest compression, 9 is best compression.
.PP
.B Y
.IP
1: compression is enabled, 0: compression is disabled.
